### Notes: Had trouble with flex. Major issues and hours spent trying to get my design idea to work. (First picture is large and grows/shrinks, bottom 4 adjust and stay centered based upon relative size and spacing of larger picture.)  Lots of frustration.  Will be signing up for tutoring for flexbox.
